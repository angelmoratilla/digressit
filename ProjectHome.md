Digress.it is an open source plugin for Wordpress that allows readers to comment paragraph by paragraph in the margins of a text. Annotate, gloss, workshop, debate: with Digress.it you can do all of these things on a finer-grained level, turning a document into a conversation. It can be applied to a fixed document (paper/essay/book etc.) or to a running blog.
